This repo is all about the firmware run on the Teensy and do the automation offline.  
While keeping the HA up to date with what is going on here.
I know this is similar to ESPHome, however that project got to my attention after I started this project. I'm a fan of a hard-wired ethernet connection, while not impossible with ESPHome, the options are less available. And after all, I built the hardware already!
