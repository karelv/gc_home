## Golden Cherry Home Automation

Be patient, this is a not released yet...
Also later I will share the t41_board...

### Hardware

- t41_board with Teensy 4.1 ==> see: todo
- home assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/)


### Software (home assistant)

- MQTT Server: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/


### Firmware (t41_board)

This repo is all about the firmware run on the Teensy and do the automation offline.  
While keeping the HA up to date with what is going on here.
I know this is similar to ESPHome, however that project got to my attention after I started this project. I'm a fan of a hard-wired ethernet connection, while not impossible with ESPHome, the options are less available. And after all, I built the hardware already!
